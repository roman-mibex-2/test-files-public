= AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference

AsciiDoc is a mature, lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.


[NOTE]
====
Several examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend.
AsciiDoc produces complementary output when generating DocBook.

Most features labeled "`Asciidoctor only`" can be made available to the native AsciiDoc processor by using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/blob/master/compat/asciidoc.conf[this AsciiDoc configuration file] from the Asciidoctor project.
